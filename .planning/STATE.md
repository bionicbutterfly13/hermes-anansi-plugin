# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-10)

**Core value:** Every Hermes turn gets a grounded metacognitive appraisal injected before response generation — with zero capacity for autonomous action and zero impact on turn reliability.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Fail-Open Hardening + Reflection

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 4 (Fail-Open Hardening + Reflection)
Plan: 03-02 COMPLETE (2 of 3) — 03-03 (live validation) next
Status: Plan 03-02 executed — schema v3, reflection engine (debounce + idempotent single-transaction apply, ±0.15 bounds, echo exclusion, lazy decay + reflection-pass prune), hooks wired (post_llm_call capture; session triggers), REFL-04/05 surfacing, matrix reflection rows filled, offline cross-session demo green; suite 68 → 105 via ./scripts/test.sh
Last activity: 2026-06-10 — Plan 03-02 complete (701549d, 7c1c235, 85897d8): reflection is the carrier — offline proof in test_reflection_demo.py; live proof is 03-03

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: ~1 session
- Total execution time: ~6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 — Skeleton + State | 2/2 | ~2h | ~1h |
| 2 — Appraisal Path | 2/2 | ~2h | ~1h |
| 3 — Fail-Open + Reflection | 2/3 | ~2h | ~1h |

## Accumulated Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Appraisal inputs = message + history + SQLite state (one-turn memory lag) | pre-1 | pre_llm_call fires before memory prefetch — ✓ accepted by Dr. Mani 2026-06-10 |
| Reflection debounced + idempotent | pre-1 | on_session_end fires per turn |
| Zero new pip dependencies | pre-1 | Host surfaces + stdlib suffice; best PR posture |
| Confidence advisory-only; noun-fields-only schema; sanitized rendering | pre-1 | Calibration noise + injection-surface defense |
| kind: standalone explicit; **kwargs on all hooks; no MemoryProvider strings | pre-1 | Manifest string-scan + dispatcher kwarg landmines |
| Plugin renamed anansi → anansi | 1 | Name collision with live "Anansi Metacognitive Guardrails" plugin (see DECISIONS.md 2026-06-10) |
| Gateway lane dispatches hooks SYNC via same call site as CLI (turn_context.py:316-341) | 1 | Verified by code read; sync complete_structured in executor is correct for both lanes (Phase 2) |
| Item 3 answered: upstream/main has provides_hooks + ctx.llm parity (183d86b3e) | 1 | Fetched + diffed 2026-06-10; PKG-03 re-check still required before Phase 4 PR |
| Live lane: anthropic claude-haiku-4-5; deadline_seconds 8.0 (not 2.5) | 2 | Empirical: haiku appraisal is 4.4–7.3s generation-bound; 2.5s times out 100% |
| Contradiction kind labels advisory-only (never branch on exact kind) | 2 | Fixtures: 6/6 detection, 0/3 FP, but semantic/narrative over-applied, relational mislabeled |
| Trust-denied config degrades to fail-open timeout on this install (not trust_fallback) | 2 | Host model sonnet-4-6 needs ~37s/appraisal > 10s deadline clamp; mechanism unit-proven |
| WAL `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE` never blocks readers (== IMMEDIATE); reader-blocking lock tests need a rollback-journal tmp DB | 3 | Verified empirically 2026-06-10; locked-DB matrix rows assert both truths (test_failopen_matrix.py) |
| Bare second-person directive payload text quoted as reported material by render._sanitize_text (SAFE-03) | 3 | "you should migrate now" rendered structurally directive; quoting keeps the line observational |
| Dev tooling staged repo-locally (.devtools/pytest via uv --target); hermes venv never modified | 3 | uv-sync wipe risk locked in 03-CONTEXT; ./scripts/test.sh is the canonical test command |
| Reflection raw read = `read_snapshot(include_decayed=True)` flag, not a second reader; apply_deltas busy-timeout default follows `_DEFAULT_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS` | 3 | store.py stays the only sqlite surface; locked-DB tests govern the real write path (03-02) |
| jsonschema (4.26.0) is live in the hermes venv: schema-rejected docs surface as parse_fail host-side; vocabulary-gating tested at the parse layer | 3 | Same split as Phase 2's parse_signals; full-path fake payloads must validate (03-02) |

## Blockers / Concerns

- ~~One-turn-lag ack~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-10: accepted by Dr. Mani; reflection carries appraisal context across the lag (R2)
- ~~p50 5501ms vs ≤1.0s target~~ RESOLVED 2026-06-10: target revised to p50 ≤6s / 8.0s deadline, max quality (R1, Dr. Mani decision)
- Upstream-main parity of ctx.llm facade + manifest keys must be re-verified before Phase 4 PR

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-10 (autonomous)
Stopped at: Plan 03-02 complete (SUMMARY written, suite 105 green via ./scripts/test.sh; offline cross-session demo proven); next step execute 03-03 (live validation — note: live v2 state.db quarantine-recreates at v3 on the first brand-new session)
